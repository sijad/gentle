# Code of Conduct

<div align="center">

Human beings are members of a whole  
since in their creation they are of one essence.  
When the conditions of the time brings a member (limb) to pain,  
the other members (limbs) will suffer from discomfort.  
You, who are indifferent to the misery of others,  
it is not fitting that they should call you a human being.

چو عضوی به‌درد آورَد روزگار&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;دگر عضوها را نمانَد قرار  
تو کز محنت دیگران بی‌غمی&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;نشاید که نامت نهند آدمی
